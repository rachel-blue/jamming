This project utilizes the spotify api 0Auth and 
[implicit Grant flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#implicit-grant-flow) 
to search, and view songs then add them to a playlist and save that playlist to 
the users Spotify account. 

This was a tutorial project from Codecademy.
